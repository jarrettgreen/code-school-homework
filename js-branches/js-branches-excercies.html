        <h3> Lions </h3>
        <hr/>
        <p> The lion (Panthera leo) is one of the four big cats in the genus Panthera and a member of the family Felidae.</p>
        <p> With some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight,[4] it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in Asia (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park in India) while other types of lions have disappeared from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times.</p>
        <p> Until the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans. They were found in most of Africa, across Eurasia from western Europe to India, and in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.[5] The lion is a vulnerable species, having seen a major population decline in its African range of 30â€“50% per two decades during the second half of the 20th century.[2] Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are currently the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.</p></p>
        <p> They are also quite tasty. </p>

        <h3> Tigers </h3>
        <hr/>
        <p> The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest cat species, reaching a total body length of up to 3.38 m (11.1 ft) over curves and weighing up to 388.7 kg (857 lb) in the wild.</p>
        <p> Its most recognisable feature is a pattern of dark vertical stripes on reddish-orange fur with a lighter underside. The species is classified in the genus Panthera with the lion, leopard and jaguar.</p>
        <p> Tigers are apex predators, primarily preying on ungulates such as deer and bovids. They are territorial and generally solitary but social animals, often requiring large contiguous areas of habitat that support their prey requirements.This, coupled with the fact that they are indigenous to some of the more densely populated places on Earth, has caused significant conflicts with humans.</p>
        <p> They are also quite tasty. </p>

        <h3> Bears </h3>

        <p> Bears will absolutely eff you up. For just no good reason. You'll just being hiking, and all of a sudden - mauled. </p>
        <p> They'll also tear up your car at the faintest hint of a peanut-butter M&M. Or a gum wrapper. Or out of sheer boredom. Cuz' what are you going to do? </p>
        <p> You know how they tell you to hang your food from trees when camping? Trust me it doesn't work. Bears can climb the hell of a tree. It's a game to them at that point </p>
        <p> Man, eff bears you guys, seriously </p>
